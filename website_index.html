		<b>Sindbad</b> <br>
		Hey! My name is Sindbad and I am a U1 student majoring in Maths and minoring in Computer Science. I am extremely excited for this semester 
		long project and I hope that by the end of the project I will have a better understanding of project design and how to cooperate with other people 
		to create a common project. My ultimate goal is to get the necessary skills to succeed at a Hackathon!
